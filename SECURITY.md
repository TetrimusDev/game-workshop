## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, make an issue with the name "Vulnerability". This will mark it as a high priority issue and will be fixed ASAP. If a vulnerability is accepted, it will be fixed by a contributor and reviewed by a member of staff. If a vulnerability is denied, the issue will be closed. Vulnerabilities will always be looked at very carefully.

You can expect an update on a vulnerability within 1-2 weeks of the vulnerability being reported.
